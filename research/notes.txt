None of the above really worked for me, but gave an idea of how it works

Increase swap size:
https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/12/18/keras-deep-learning-raspberry-pi/

To increase your swap space, open up /etc/dphys-swapfile and then edit the CONF_SWAPSIZE variable:

Keras and deep learning on the Raspberry Pi
# set size to absolute value, leaving empty (default) then uses computed value
#   you most likely don't want this, unless you have a special disk situation
# CONF_SWAPSIZE=100
CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024
Notice that I am increasing the swap from 100MB to 1024MB.

From there, restart the swap service:

Keras and deep learning on the Raspberry Pi
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start

Note: Increasing swap size is a great way to burn out your memory card, so be sure to revert this change and restart the swap service when youâ€™re done. You can read more about large sizes corrupting memory cards here.
