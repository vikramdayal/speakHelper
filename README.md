# speakHelper

Welcome to speakHelper project. This is project is a hardware and software based project to help children with speech impediment.

Objective is to come up with a portable device with a touch screen that can "speak" on behalf of children with a speech impediment. Since my nephew can already read, I am building a text prompt utility. However, with simple tweaks, it should be possible to prompt images instead.

The project is essentially based on raspberry pi 4 with the following components:
1. The harware: raspberry pi 4, touch screen and speakers
2. The environmental text to speeach software: Using google tts
3. Python drivers to create wave files and play them as sound
4. GUI service to offer word suggestions and construct the sentences to speak
5. Deep learning to create a predive keyboard.
6. Bing search and keyword prompt (later might change it to google, bt right now looks a little more expensive)
